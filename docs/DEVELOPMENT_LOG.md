# AgentBridge development log
Append one dated entry for each substantial incremental development session. Link the PR and CI result. This is a history, not an aspirational checklist.

## 2026-11-08 — Foundation
- Initialized previously empty public repository.
- Committed canonical North Star, design system, six static website pages, interaction script, icon, and backend reference.
- Designed a D1-backed, short-lived reservation lifecycle with a single permitted test number and HMAC-signed Twilio webhook processing.
- Added test scaffolding, CI and hourly quality-check workflow.
- Known gaps: no deployed site, no provider credentials, no real account/customer billing, no Grok Bot end-to-end verification, no independent browser QA. Do not present preview as a live product.

## 2026-11-08 — Preview deployment and hourly development
- Added a GitHub Pages deployment workflow (preview deployment requires Pages configuration in repository settings); Cloudflare Pages build output is also documented.
- Created an hourly ChatGPT development automation to inspect the repo, implement a nonduplicate priority change and submit a reviewable PR; auto-merge/deployment is prohibited.
- Added the [P1 native Grok Bot international test call acceptance issue](https://github.com/premiumcentraal-boop/AgentBridge/issues/1).
- Verified through the GitHub connector that the source files, North Star, CI workflow and deployment workflow exist in main.
- Not verified: actual automated CI success, deployment URL accessibility, live telecom integration, and real native Grok Bot international call.

## 2026-11-08 — Independent website integrity and accessibility checks (PR pending)
- Built a dependency-free static-site audit covering all six published pages, internal navigation/assets, broken fragments, duplicate IDs, accessible form labels, image alternatives, landmarks, and basic document metadata.
- Added automated negative regression tests and integrated the audit with CI and GitHub Pages project-site deployment. This is intentionally separate from open PR #2's inbound telephony security changes.
- Test execution status: not verified locally because the execution container cannot resolve github.com to clone the repository; GitHub Actions must validate before merge.
- Browser WCAG checks, color contrast, keyboard interaction, responsive layout and screen-reader testing remain open; static checks are not a WCAG certification.
